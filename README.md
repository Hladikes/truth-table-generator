# Truth table generator

Currently deployed at http://logic.hldks.net/

### I made this tool to help me evaluate various logical expressions for various combinations of bits.

### I made this tool in one night, and truth to be told, it will take me some time to comment it properly ðŸ¥´

### Quality of the code wasn't the main objective for me, I was trying to make this tool as quickly as possible, so please, don't take this as an inspiration :)
